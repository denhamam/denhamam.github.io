Hello! I'm Ainsley Denham. I am a student at Colorado State University perusing a bachelors degree in science, majoring in ecosystem science and sustainability. With this degree I hope to become a climate scientist and study the effects of climate change globally. I am comitted to enviornmental stewardship and community engagement. I love being in nature, whether its hiking, playing volleyball, or exploring new landscapes.
